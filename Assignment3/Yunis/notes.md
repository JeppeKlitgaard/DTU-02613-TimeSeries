### Correlations:

- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient:** Measures the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, -1 a perfect negative correlation, and 0 no correlation.
- **Correlation Coefficient (General):** This is a broader term that includes different types of correlation measures, such as Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlation. Pearson is the most commonly used.
- **Cross-Correlation:** Used primarily in signal processing and time series analysis. It measures the similarity between two signals as a function of the time lag applied to one of them. Unlike Pearson correlation, which assumes simultaneous comparison, cross-correlation helps identify time shifts between signals.
- **Auto-Correlation:** similarity between a signal with a lagged version of itself


### TO DO:
- update 3.4
    - estimate parameters from ACF and PACF?
    - model P response, impulse from T and G
    - create own parameter estimation model because AutoReg only takes one exogenous variable
